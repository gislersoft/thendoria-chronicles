# Thendoria Chronicles
Thendoria Chronicles is an old Turbo C++ game that I wrote in 2003, was lost for almost 20 years and was finally found in an old CD-ROM copy, I decided to create this repo in order to never lost this game again, and of course to finish it!

# Development History
Some of the libraries here were started or developed between 1998 to 2003, also a build a tile creator tool exclusively for the game is also here in this same repo as TILCRE.CPP

# Plot
Thendoria Kingdom has been invaded by the seventh Forkian army (an army of killer plants with grape shapes) led by Gagero a giant lizard from the Lazart Kingdom. Pharax a soldier from the Thendoria castle that was unconscious because of a previous battle was rescued by a very strange wizard called Rosco that can transform himself into a sea dragon and or other multiple creatures, has to wake up. Now Pharax must save the Kingdom from the Forkians!

# Music
The music of the game has been composed completely in code and you will have that beautiful "pitifonic sound" (beeps) from the 70s, 80s, and some 90s games before sound blaster.
